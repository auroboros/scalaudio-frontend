# scalaudio-frontend
#### RPC client app

This is a Play2 front-end project to demo how to connect a front-end to Scalaudio's back-end RPC endpoint. 

I considered just housing this within Scalaudio as another module but Intellij seems to be confused when compiling a Play2 module alongside many other non-Play modules. Also, this is technically more like example/test code than a real module. (Maybe I'll add some simple servlet module in the other project? I like the idea of cloning 1 repo and being able to pretty much run any demo with a single click...)
